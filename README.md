# How to Extract Text from Images with Python?

OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is the process of electronical conversion of Digital images into machine-encoded text. Where the digital image is generally an image that contains regions that resemble characters of a language. OCR is a field of research in pattern recognition, artificial intelligence and computer vision. This is due to the fact that newer OCRâ€™s are trained by providing them sample data which is ran over a machine learning algorithm. This technique of extracting text from images is generally carried out in work environments where it is certain that the image would be containing text data. In this article, we would learn about extracting text from images. We would be utilizing python programming language for doing so. 

For enabling our python program to have Character recognition capabilities, we would be making use of pytesseract OCR library. The library could be installed onto our python environment by executing the following command in the command interpreter of the OS:-
## pip install pytesseract
